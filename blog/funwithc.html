        <h1>Fun (TM) with C</h1>
        <h2>Note: very simplified</h2>
        <h3>The beginning</h3>
        <p>Ok, so I was experimenting with pointers during my free time and found something interesting.</p>
        <p>I could modify a variable using another variable. You may already know where I'm going with this.</p>
        <h3>"Memory Safe", more like a joke</h3>
        <p>Let's take this program:</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 3;
    int c = 4;
    int d = {2, 5};
    printf("a = %d, b = %d, c = %d, d = {%d, %d}\n", a, b, c, d[0], d[1]);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>It's just a toy program that makes variable a, b, and c and makes a array d.</p>
        <p>And in C, variables first are in the stack top.</p>
        <p>So our memory looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>
bottom                 top
+----+----+----+----+----+
| d0 | d1 | c  | b  | a  |
+----+----+----+----+----+

</code></pre>
        <p>Now, for the trolling:</p>
        <p>Our objective is to change A through B.</p>
        <p>How would we do this? Well, we can refrence B to get a pointer:</p>
<pre><code>

                   &b
                    v
+----+----+----+----+----+
| d0 | d1 | c  | b  | a  |
+----+----+----+----+----+

</code></pre>
        <p>We can then add b by 1 to get a pointer to A.</p>
<pre><code>

                   &b+1
                     v
+----+----+----+----+----+
| d0 | d1 | c  | b  | a  |
+----+----+----+----+----+

</code></pre>
        <p>Then we can derefence our pointer to get A. Now, we can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>
*((&b)+1) = 13; /* Oh no! A is now 13! */
</code></pre>
        <p>This kids, is the wonders and fun of C.</p>
        <p>FYI: This works on my machine, so.....</p>
