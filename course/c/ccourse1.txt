====== STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ======



1. Set up gcc or tcc or clang, etc.
*I'll be using gcc in this course.

1a. Hello World Program
We'll explain what this means later, but this is a hello world in C.
Mind that in C you need to use semicolons (python sucks)

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!);
    return 0;
}

compile with gcc:
    gcc -o <executable name>.exe <filename>.c
compile with tcc:
    tcc -o <executable name>.exe <filename>.c
compile with clang:
    clang -o <executable name>.exe <filename>.c



2. the include part.

Normally in programming languages, you heard of something called 'librarys' or 'include files'. Well, this is one of them.
There are many librarys in c, in fact, that im not going to list all of them. You'll learn some along the way.

"stdio.h" is the Standard input/output library, which has functions like printf() and many more input/output functions that are useful in C programming.

Speaking of printf()...

2a. printf()

printf, or Print Formatted, is a print function sort of identical to java's System.console.println() or python's print().
ex. printf("Hi.") prints out in the console:

Hi.

that's all you need to know (FOR NOW!). Keep in mind you need the quotation marks.

2b. int main()

If you couldn't read, this is the main function. Upon execution, the program will call this function.
the 'int' part in the beginning is the return type.
The "return 0" in this function is the return, and ill give you a list of the possible codes.

return 0 --- Program done succesfully.
return 1 --- Program done unsuccesfully.

It's binary.

3. All variable types, and how and why you need to use them
